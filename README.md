Merging Two Arrays in Java
Description

This Java program demonstrates how to merge two integer arrays into a single array. It compares elements from both arrays and stores them in a new array. After merging, the program prints the combined array to the console.

How the Program Works

Two integer arrays (l1 and l2) are initialized with predefined values.

The lengths of both arrays are calculated.

A new array merged is created with a size equal to the sum of both array lengths.

Using while loops, elements from both arrays are inserted into the merged array.

Remaining elements (if any) are added after the comparison loop.

Finally, the merged array is printed.

Input:

Array 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Array 2: {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
